# Rendering Particles (Manual)

With the Blender file and the Python script 3d models of cloud particles can be rendered.
New models can also be created. The Python code must then be adapted accordingly.
To execute the rendering, proceed as follows:

#### In Blender:
1. (Optional) Create new 3d Model. Make sure the model uses the OpaqueBlenderRender material.

#### In Python script:
2. (Optional) Add particle tuple to the PARTICLES list and add configurations for this new particle
   (at the end of the script).
3. Change the output directory DIRECTORY.

#### In Blender:
4. (Optional) Change the resolution in pixels.
5. Reload and run script in Blender.
