**oap** - Optical Array Processing for Python (v0.0.10)
=======================================================

The `oap library <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oap/>`_ is a transparent tool for working directly with image data from `Optical Array Probes <https://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/two-dimensional-optical-array-cloud-probe>`_.
It was initially developed for the preparation and classification of image data with neural networks.

                                                         Version 0.0.10

**This software will be continuously developed further!** Comments on this project are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvement, you can simply write me an `email <mailto:lucasgrulich@gmx.de>`_ and I will try to implement them.

I have already written a lot of other code that is not yet ready to be released. But little by little I will try to make the code available for everyone.

At the current state, the decompression algorithm is only available for grayscale probes by `Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT) <https://www.dropletmeasurement.com/>`_.

* Decompression for DMT monoscale probes coming next! (Version 0.1.1)
* Sizing Method: Area Ratio
